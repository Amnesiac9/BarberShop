Let's get you more experience with React. We will build a website for a barber shop.
1. Users should be able to browse a set of available hair cuts
2. Users should be able to see the barbers schedule
3. Users should be able to schedule a hair cut

I want you to look into and select a UI library (or roll your own).
* Ant Design
* Glue UI
* MUI
* TailwindCSS (I don't think their React library is free though)

I want you to look into Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)
I want you to look into ViteJS for templating your project

I want your site to be responsive to mobile and desktop viewport sizes.

What is out of scope:
* Setting up an API (we can get away with a hardcoded API or mock fetch functions)
* Persisting data (bonus points if you use local storage)
* Deployment pipelines, linting tools, and any other nice to haves. We just need to be able to start a local server
